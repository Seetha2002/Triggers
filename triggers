Triggers are stored programs, which are automatically executed or fired when some events occur. Triggers are, in fact, written to be executed in response to any of the following events −

A database manipulation (DML) statement (DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE)

A database definition (DDL) statement (CREATE, ALTER, or DROP).

A database operation (SERVERERROR, LOGON, LOGOFF, STARTUP, or SHUTDOWN).

Triggers can be defined on the table, view, schema, or database with which the event is associated.

Benefits of Triggers:
Triggers can be written for the following purposes −

Generating some derived column values automatically.
Enforcing referential integrity.
Event logging and storing information on table access.
Auditing.
Synchronous replication of tables.
Imposing security authorizations.
Preventing invalid transactions.
Creating Triggers:
The syntax for creating a trigger is −

CREATE [OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER trigger_name  
{BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF }  
{INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE}  
[OF col_name]  
ON table_name  
[REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n]  
[FOR EACH ROW]  
WHEN (condition)   
DECLARE 
   Declaration-statements 
BEGIN  
   Executable-statements 
EXCEPTION 
   Exception-handling-statements 
END;
